Cookiecutter template for a Jina Executor

## Quick start

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.7.3 or higher)::

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate a Jina project:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:jina-ai/cookiecutter-jina-hub
```

## Fork This / Create Your Own

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not you rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.
